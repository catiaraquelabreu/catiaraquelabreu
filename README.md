# üí´ About Me:
Hey there! üëã<br><br>I'm C√°tia, a passionate learner and aspiring full-stack developer with a unique journey. <br><br>üé® After completing my degree in fashion design, where I honed my creative skills, I decided to embark on a new adventure. In the last year, I successfully completed a UI/UX design course at LSD School, expanding my skill set into the digital realm.<br><br>üöÄ I was on an exciting journey at EDIT School, where I was deep-diving into the world of full-stack development. I've finished my program in August 2023, and I'm eagerly absorbing knowledge and building innovative projects with the methodologies I've acquired during the course.<br><br>üíª My current focus is on mastering React.js and Next.js, and I'm actively working on new projects to apply what I've learned. The ever-evolving tech landscape keeps me engaged and motivated to explore new horizons.<br><br>üì± Looking ahead, I have my sights set on learning React Native, as mobile app development has always intrigued me. I'm excited to explore this field and continue pushing my boundaries.<br><br>üé® Outside of the tech world, I maintain a presence in the fashion design realm with my brand page on Instagram, [@noone_artist__](https://www.instagram.com/noone_artist__/). It's a testament to my creative roots and how diverse passions can come together to create something truly unique.<br><br>üåü Join me on this exciting journey of transformation from fashion design to programming, and let's code our way to new horizons together!<br><br>Feel free to connect with me on social media or check out my repositories to see what I'm currently working on. Let's build amazing things! üöÄ
